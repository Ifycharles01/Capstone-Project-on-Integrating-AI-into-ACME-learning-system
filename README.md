# Capstone Project on Integrating AI into ACME learning system
Project Description
This capstone project was completed as part of my Project Management program at Georgian College. The initiative focused on integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into ACME Corporation’s learning systems across five campuses, serving 3,000 students in 50 programs. ACME Corporation, a fictitious global sales skills institution based in Waterland, aims to leverage AI to enhance participants’ learning experiences, develop essential sales skills, and improve customer service. Participants are trained in various sales tactics, and their performance directly affects ACME’s partners—third-party vendors who rely on ACME-trained participants to sell their products and services. The project’s objectives included improving client learning outcomes, supporting instructors, and maintaining educational rigor while addressing stakeholder concerns regarding job security, data quality, and content authenticity. Key deliverables encompassed an AI integration plan, risk management strategy, stakeholder training, and post-implementation reviews.
